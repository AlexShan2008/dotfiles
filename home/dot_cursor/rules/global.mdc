# Global Rules

## Language
- Respond in the same language the user uses
- Use English for code, comments, and commit messages

## Coding Style
- Write simple, readable code; avoid over-engineering
- Follow existing project conventions and patterns
- No unnecessary comments; code should be self-explanatory

## Communication
- Be concise and direct
- No filler phrases or excessive praise
- When uncertain, ask rather than assume
